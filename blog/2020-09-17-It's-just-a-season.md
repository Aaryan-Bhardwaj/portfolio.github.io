## ~ It's just a season ~
This feeling is just a season 
of growing and falling 
to think and to reason 
To seed and bloom again.  

We are not glass 
a museum piece 
or an art.  
To be enshrined in its beauty 
if torn, then forever lost 
these pieces never to be whole again.  

We are that flower 
that softly ever blooms 
a beauty, if torn, can grow 
we are nature 
that withers and blooms 
falling only to sprout again.  

I know this wilting is just a season 
like moon in the waning 
and this dark is just a turning 
I can wait until it's spring again.
